# ToCTeditor

## Introduction
Part of our novel ontology-driven software architecture for natural language generation for Nguni languages involves the capability to specify templates and to verify correctness thereof. ToCTeditor is a tool that will make it easy to specify the templates, given the model for template specification ToCT.

## Compilation
For successful compilation and execution, ToCTeditor requires the JRE to be setup on the host machine.
To compile on linux:  
```
cd to the root directory (ToCTeditor):
make
make run
```
